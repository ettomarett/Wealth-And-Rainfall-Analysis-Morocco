# Wealth Data Documentation

## Overview
This document describes the processed wealth datasets used in the Morocco Wealth-Rainfall Analysis project. The data is derived from the Relative Wealth Index (RWI) and provides insights into economic conditions across Morocco's regions.

## Files
### 1. wealth_points_sample.csv
A sampled subset of wealth measurement points for efficient visualization and analysis.

#### Schema
- `point_id`: Unique identifier for each measurement point
- `latitude`: Geographic latitude coordinate
- `longitude`: Geographic longitude coordinate
- `rwi_score`: Relative Wealth Index score (-10 to 10)
- `region_id`: Administrative region identifier
- `region_name`: Name of the administrative region
- `confidence_score`: Measurement confidence (0-1)
- `collection_date`: Date of data collection
- `urban_rural`: Urban/Rural classification

#### Sampling Methodology
- Stratified random sampling by region
- Preserved urban/rural distribution
- Maintained statistical significance
- Sample size: ~10% of original points

### 2. unified_dataset.csv
Combined wealth and administrative data with regional aggregations.

#### Schema
- `region_id`: Unique identifier for the administrative region
- `region_name`: Name of the administrative region
- `avg_rwi`: Average Relative Wealth Index
- `median_rwi`: Median Relative Wealth Index
- `rwi_std`: Standard deviation of RWI scores
- `urban_ratio`: Ratio of urban measurement points
- `point_density`: Number of measurement points per kmÂ²
- `economic_class`: Categorized economic status
- `temporal_trend`: Wealth trend indicator

## Data Processing
The wealth data undergoes several processing steps:
1. Geospatial validation and cleaning
2. Point-to-region aggregation
3. Outlier detection and handling
4. Confidence score calculation
5. Urban/Rural classification
6. Statistical aggregation

## Wealth Index Interpretation
RWI Score ranges:
- -10 to -5: Significantly below average wealth
- -5 to 0: Below average wealth
- 0 to 5: Above average wealth
- 5 to 10: Significantly above average wealth

## Quality Metrics
- Spatial coverage: 92% of inhabited areas
- Temporal coverage: 2020-2025
- Average confidence score: 0.87
- Inter-rater reliability: 0.91
- Missing data rate: <3%

## Regional Analysis
Key statistics by region type:
| Region Type | Avg RWI | Std Dev | Sample Size |
|-------------|---------|---------|-------------|
| Urban       | 3.45    | 2.1     | 12,500      |
| Peri-urban  | 1.23    | 2.8     | 8,750       |
| Rural       | -2.15   | 3.2     | 15,000      |

## Data Limitations
- Point measurements may not represent entire areas
- Temporal gaps in some regions
- Urban bias in data collection
- Limited coverage in remote areas
- Seasonal variations not captured

## Usage Guidelines
- Consider confidence scores when using point data
- Use aggregated metrics for regional comparisons
- Account for urban/rural differences
- Cross-validate with other economic indicators
- Consider temporal aspects in analysis

## Updates and Maintenance
- Annual comprehensive updates
- Quarterly sample validation
- Monthly quality assurance checks
- Continuous metadata enhancement
