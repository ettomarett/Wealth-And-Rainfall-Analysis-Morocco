# LSTM Rainfall Forecasting Documentation

## What is LSTM?
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) designed to model sequential data and capture long-term dependencies. LSTMs are widely used for time series forecasting, especially when the data has complex temporal patterns.

## How LSTM Would Be Applied
- **Data Selection:**
  - The user selects a region and a rainfall metric (e.g., monthly mean rainfall).
  - The time series for the selected region and metric is extracted from the processed rainfall dataset.
- **Preprocessing:**
  - The time series is normalized/scaled and reshaped into a supervised learning format (e.g., using sliding windows).
  - Data is split into training and test sets.
- **Model Design:**
  - An LSTM model is built using TensorFlow/Keras, typically with one or more LSTM layers followed by dense layers.
- **Training:**
  - The model is trained on the historical rainfall data to learn temporal patterns.
- **Forecasting:**
  - The trained model predicts future rainfall values for the next 12 periods (e.g., months).
- **Visualization:**
  - Both historical and forecasted values are plotted for comparison.

## Assumptions & Limitations
- LSTM requires sufficient data to learn temporal patterns; small datasets may lead to overfitting.
- Model performance depends on hyperparameter tuning (e.g., window size, number of layers, epochs).
- LSTM is computationally intensive and requires TensorFlow/Keras.
- The current implementation is a placeholder; further setup and adaptation to the dataset are needed for a working model.
